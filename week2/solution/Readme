The solution was developed in the browser platform IDE50, to run it externally CS50.h would have to be included as it is not in the common includes for the compiler.

The program notes obtains the frequency of the notes correctly, synthesize is not working correctly as there's a seg fault being caused when calling one of the functions, this seems to be happening when a function is called which expects a string in a formatted as fraction (x/y), however the string seems to be null all of the time. The function that sends the string was provided as part of the code, and isn;t supposed to be altered as detailed on the problem set, it may be that the inputs given through the terminal don't work correclty and a different format is needed.
